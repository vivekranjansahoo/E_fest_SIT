              The Entrepreneurship Development Cell (ED Cell) at SiliconTech,
              was established in 2011 to encourage and promote entrepreneurship

              Technical Education (AICTE) and the Department of Science &

              opportunities for selfemployment, and train students to have an
              intrapreneurial mindset for future workplaces. The EDC offers
              access to affordable co-working spaces, mentoring, training, and
              funding to incubatees. It also hosts various entrepreneurship
              development programs, including the Women Entrepreneurship
              Development Program and the Technology Entrepreneurship
